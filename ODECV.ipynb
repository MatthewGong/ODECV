    "There are a few things that we need to define. There are several different ways to use differential equations in computer vision problems. We can treat the image itself as a 2D function of the form $u:\\Omega \\to \\mathbb{R}$, $\\Omega \\subset \\mathbb{R}^2$. However, in the process of image capture/creation noise or other kinds of distortion can occur, hence it is more accurate to define a digital image as $u_0 = \\alpha \\ast u + \\nu$, where $\\alpha$ denotes some blur and $\\nu$ is some additive noise, usually modelled as gaussian noise. In this case we're given $u_0$ to process and we wish to recover $u$ by using solving the inverse to the initial problem. A common way do this is minimize energy functionals of the form: F(u) = $\\frac{1}{2}\\int\\limits_\\Omega |u_0 - Ru|^2$ $dx$ + $ \\lambda \\int\\limits_\\Omega \\phi(|\\nabla u|) dx$. This first term $\\frac{1}{2}\\int\\limits_\\Omega |u_0 - Ru|^2$ $dx$ is called the fidelity portion of the energy functional and ensures that we don't alter the original image too much. The second term $ \\lambda \\int\\limits_\\Omega \\phi(|\\nabla u|) dx$ is the smoothing term which helps remove noise or blur. This has several limitations depending on the choice of $\\phi$ which we will explore in more detail later on.\n",

    "Another way to use PDE/ODE methods in computer vision is to define the video as sequences of captured images. A common algorithm that uses this is optical flow, which tracks movement and objects through a scene. Again, we define the image as $u:\\Omega \\to \\mathbb{R}$, $\\Omega \\subset \\mathbb{R}^2$, but now we have to add in a new term to account for the change in time, $\\Delta t$ and $k$. We define our video as $u+k\\Delta t$. \n",
